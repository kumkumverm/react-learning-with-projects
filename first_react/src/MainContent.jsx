        <ol>
            <li>React is a popular library, so I will be able to fit in with all the coolest devs out there!😎</li>
            <li>I am more likely to get a job as a front end developer if I know React</li>
            <li> Because vanilla JavaScript is like cooking from scratch… React is like ordering pizza. 🍕</li>
            <li>So I can finally understand all those React memes on LinkedIn. 😂</li>
